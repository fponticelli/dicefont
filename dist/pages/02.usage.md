# Usage

To use *dicefont* in a webpage, you have to refer its main CSS file. You can do it using the CDN version or downloading the files locally and point to them.

## CDN Version

For the CDN version add the following snippet to your HTML page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="${cdndist}dicefont/dicefont.css">
```

Note that the file will never be automatically updated. To refer to newer (or older) versions you will have to change the version hash in the url between `fponticelli/dicefont/` and `/dist/dicefont/dicefont.css`.

## Local Setup

For a local setup you have to download [these files](${cdndist}dicefont.zip).

Unzip the file in your project and be sure to point to `dicefont.css` from your HTML file.

## Use Icons

To use an icon use the following syntax:

```html
<i class="df-d4-2"></i>
```

To find the right the right class for the right die face refer to the homepage content.

If you are interested in just the SVGs you can download them [here](${cdndist}dicefont.zip).
