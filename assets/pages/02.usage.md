# Usage

To use **dicefont** in a webpage, you have to link its main CSS file. You can do it by using the CDN version or by downloading the files locally to your project and by pointing to them.

## CDN Version

For the CDN version add the following snippet to your HTML page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="${cdndist}dicefont/dicefont.css">
```

Note that when new versions are released, the file will never be automatically updated. To refer to newer (or older) versions you will have to change the version hash in the url between `fponticelli/dicefont/` and `/dist/dicefont/dicefont.css`.

## Local Setup

For a local setup you have to download the [dicefont.zip](${cdndist}dicefont.zip) file.

Unzip the file in your project and make sure to have you HTML file link to `dicefont.css`.

## Use Icons

To use an icon in your HTML you have to use the following syntax:

```html
<i class="df-d20-1"></i>
```

To find the right class for the right die face refer to the homepage content.

If you are interested in just the SVGs you can download the file [dicefont-icons.zip](${cdndist}dicefont-icons.zip).
